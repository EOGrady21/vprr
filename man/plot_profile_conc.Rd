\title{Plot a profile of taxa specific ROI concentration}
\usage{
plot_profile_conc(data, taxa, binSize, imageVolume)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{dataframe which will be run through bin_profile_taxa (see function requirements)}

\item{taxa}{taxa of interest}

\item{binSize}{required for bin_profile_taxa (size in metres over which data will be averaged)}

\item{imageVolume}{required for bin_profile_taxa (volume of ROI images calculated in mm^3)}
}
\description{
Plot a profile of taxa specific ROI concentration
}
\note{
this function contains hard coding of concentration calculation based on image volume
and may require updates with different sampling methods

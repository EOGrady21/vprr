\title{Function to check results of classification manually}
\usage{
vpr_manual_classification(
  day,
  hour,
  basepath,
  taxa_of_interest,
  gr = TRUE,
  scale = "x300",
  opticalSetting = "S2",
  img_bright = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{day}{day of interest in autoid}

\item{hour}{hour of interest in autoid}

\item{basepath}{file path to auto id folder eg 'E:/autoID_EC_07032019/'}

\item{taxa_of_interest}{list of taxa folders you wish you sort through}

\item{gr}{logical indicating whether pop up graphic menus are used (user preference - defaults to TRUE)}

\item{scale}{argument passed to \code{\link{image_scale}}, default = 'x300'}

\item{opticalSetting}{specifies optical setting of VPR, defining image frame
size, current options are 'S0', 'S1', 'S2' (default), 'S3', see further
info in details}

\item{img_bright}{logical value indicating whether or not to include a blown
out high brightness version of image (can be helpful for viewing dark field
fine appendages)}
}
\description{
Displays each image in day hour specified,
prompts user to confirm or deny classification.
If classification is denied, asks for a reclassification
 value based on available taxa
}
\details{
Optical Setting frame sizes: S0 = 7x7 mm, S1 = 14x14mm, S2 =
  24x24mm, S3 = 48x48 mm. These settings define the conversion factor from
  pixels to millimetres and calculate image size for classification
  reference
}
\section{Development}{

  \itemize{
      \item Add "undo" functionality to go back on a typing mistake
      \item  Fix scaling/ size issue so images are consistently sized
      \item show ROI number for image somewhere for reference when in doubt of classification
      }

The goal of vprr is to process Video Plankton Recorder (VPR) data in R.
This package allows for manual image classification, calculation of
important ecological metrics such as concentration of plankton, data
visualization, and data output with self-contained metadata.

Detailed information about vprr can be found in the package vignette.

## Installation

You can install the released version of vprr from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("vprr")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EOGrady21/vprr")
```

## Details

vprr is designed to be used after processing VPR data with an automated
image classification system. vprr utilizes file formats and directory
structures consistent with those from Visual Plankton (VP), a Matlab
image classification software designed for VPR datasets; however, vprr
is not dependent on any specific elements of VP.

All the technical details of vprr can be found in the package vignette,
available through Rstudio or at <https://eogrady21.github.io/vprr/>
(under Articles).

green and yellow boxes represent data sets, where yellow is visual data
and green is text format data. This package represents ‘Processing and
Visualization (R)’.

The first element of processing VPR data is to classify the images
collected. This can be done using machine learning techniques and then
checked and manually edited in vprr. vprr uses a GUI, called through
`vpr_manual_classification()` to allow a user to review and change image
classifications.

VPR images are displayed in the RStudio Viewer (right), prompts are
displayed in the RStudio console (left). Users are asked if
classifications are correct, if not, they are asked to select the proper
classification from a pre-set list of categories.

Once images have been properly classified, all data sources are
combined, in order to analyze data and calculate metrics such as
plankton concentration. Data from CTD files (`vpr_ctd_read()`) and image
classification (`vpr_autoid_read()`) can be read in and combined into
data frames. vprr can combine VPR CTD, and VPR image classifications
into depth bins, and calculate concentration
(`vpr_roi_concentration()`).

After data is processed, it can be visualized for easy interpretation.
Although this package does not focus on visualization, it does provide
some basic plotting functions for tow-yo VPR data
(`vpr_plot_contour()`).
